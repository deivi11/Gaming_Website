		<p> The 1980's brought the competitiveness between home computers and video game consoles.<br> People were not buying the idea of purchasing gaming consoles when they already had a<br> machine at home that could do the functions that this new machine was offering. During this<br> period, we had the Video Game crash in North America. This crash was the largest crash there<br> ever was. It was due to the oversaturated game console market and also the competition in<br> prices between the computer homes and the consoles started to increase price.<br> Many games such as Pacman on arcade were very successful so Atari decided to buy the rights<br> and included Pacman on their consoles and it was a huge failure due to the games resolution and<br> other factors such as loss of publishing rights due to many consoles being named and thrown at the public. </p>
